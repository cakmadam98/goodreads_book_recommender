      "description": "It is the amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. Cheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life, for example a good job, a loving relationship, money or possessions, health or spiritual peace of mind. The maze is where you look for what you want, perhaps the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in. The problem is that the cheese keeps moving.  In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change in their search for the cheese. One of them eventually deals with change successfully and writes what he has learned on the maze walls for you to discover.",

      ],
      "description": "If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.  The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.   Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we're too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.  Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. Tomorrow's champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today's marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.   Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.",

      "description": "In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.  In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima\\xe2\\x80\\x94and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, they battled to the island\\'s highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag.  Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.  To his family, John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>, James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men\\'s paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific\\'s most crucial island\\xe2\\x80\\x94an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.  But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photo\\xe2\\x80\\x94three were killed during the battle\\xe2\\x80\\x94were proclaimed heroes and flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering. Only James Bradley\\'s father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph in his home, telling his son only: \"The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who didn\\'t come back.\"  Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war and its aftermath as well as <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>. A penetrating, epic look at a generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.   <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

        "Julie Powell"
      ],
      "description": "With the humor of Bridget Jones and the vitality of Augusten Burroughs, Julie Powell recounts how she conquered every recipe in Julia Child\\'s Mastering the Art of French Cooking and saved her soul!  Julie Powell is 30-years-old, living in a rundown apartment in Queens and working at a soul-sucking secretarial job that's going nowhere. She needs something to break the monotony of her life, and she invents a deranged assignment. She will take her mother\\'s dog-eared copy of Julia Child\\'s 1961 classic Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and she will cook all 524 recipes. In the span of one year.   At first she thinks it will be easy. But as she moves from the simple Potage Parmentier (potato soup) into the more complicated realm of aspics and cr\\xc3\\xa9pes, she realizes there's more to Mastering the Art of French Cooking than meets the eye. With Julia's stern warble always in her ear, Julie haunts the local butcher, buying kidneys and sweetbreads. She sends her husband on late-night runs for yet more butter and rarely serves dinner before midnight. She discovers how to mold the perfect Orange Bavarian, the trick to extracting marrow from bone, and the intense pleasure of eating liver.   And somewhere along the line she realizes she has turned her kitchen into a miracle of creation and cuisine. She has eclipsed her life's ordinariness through spectacular humor, hysteria, and perseverance.",

Influenced by works such as Don Juan, and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide: the question of living or not living in an absurd universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Camus posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.",
