      "description": "It is the amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. Cheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life, for example a good job, a loving relationship, money or possessions, health or spiritual peace of mind. The maze is where you look for what you want, perhaps the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in. The problem is that the cheese keeps moving.  In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change in their search for the cheese. One of them eventually deals with change successfully and writes what he has learned on the maze walls for you to discover.",

      ],
      "description": "If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.  The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.   Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we're too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.  Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. Tomorrow's champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today's marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.   Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.",

      "description": "In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.  In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima\\xe2\\x80\\x94and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, they battled to the island\\'s highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag.  Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.  To his family, John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>, James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men\\'s paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific\\'s most crucial island\\xe2\\x80\\x94an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.  But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photo\\xe2\\x80\\x94three were killed during the battle\\xe2\\x80\\x94were proclaimed heroes and flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering. Only James Bradley\\'s father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph in his home, telling his son only: \"The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who didn\\'t come back.\"  Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war and its aftermath as well as <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>. A penetrating, epic look at a generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.   <i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

      "description": "With the humor of Bridget Jones and the vitality of Augusten Burroughs, Julie Powell recounts how she conquered every recipe in Julia Child\\'s Mastering the Art of French Cooking and saved her soul!  Julie Powell is 30-years-old, living in a rundown apartment in Queens and working at a soul-sucking secretarial job that's going nowhere. She needs something to break the monotony of her life, and she invents a deranged assignment. She will take her mother\\'s dog-eared copy of Julia Child\\'s 1961 classic Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and she will cook all 524 recipes. In the span of one year.   At first she thinks it will be easy. But as she moves from the simple Potage Parmentier (potato soup) into the more complicated realm of aspics and cr\\xc3\\xa9pes, she realizes there's more to Mastering the Art of French Cooking than meets the eye. With Julia's stern warble always in her ear, Julie haunts the local butcher, buying kidneys and sweetbreads. She sends her husband on late-night runs for yet more butter and rarely serves dinner before midnight. She discovers how to mold the perfect Orange Bavarian, the trick to extracting marrow from bone, and the intense pleasure of eating liver.   And somewhere along the line she realizes she has turned her kitchen into a miracle of creation and cuisine. She has eclipsed her life's ordinariness through spectacular humor, hysteria, and perseverance.",

In this riveting new book, Ian Davidson provides a fresh look at this vital moment in European history. He reveals how it was an immensely complicated and multifaceted revolution, taking place in different places, at different times, and in different spheres; and how subsequently it became weighted with political, social, and moral values. Stirring and dramatic\\xe2\\x80\\x94and filled with the larger-than-life players of the period and evoking the turbulence of this colorful time\\xe2\\x80\\x94this is narrative history at its finest.

Alice Walker\\'s iconic modern classic is now a Penguin Book.</b>  A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, <i>The Color Purple</i> depicts the lives of African American women in early twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance and silence. Through a series of letters spanning twenty years, first from Celie to God, then the sisters to each other despite the unknown, the novel draws readers into its rich and memorable portrayals of Celie, Nettie, Shug Avery and Sofia and their experience. <i>The Color Purple</i> broke the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, narrating the lives of women through their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery. Deeply compassionate and beautifully imagined, Alice Walker\\'s epic carries readers on a spirit-affirming journey towards redemption and love.",

Of the three dominant ideologies of the twentieth century\\xe2\\x80\\x94fascism, communism, and liberalism\\xe2\\x80\\x94only the last remains. This has created a peculiar situation in which liberalism's proponents tend to forget that it <i>is</i> an ideology and not the natural end-state of human political evolution. As Patrick Deneen argues in this provocative book, liberalism is built on a foundation of contradictions: it trumpets equal rights while fostering incomparable material inequality; its legitimacy rests on consent, yet it discourages civic commitments in favor of privatism; and in its pursuit of individual autonomy, it has given rise to the most far-reaching, comprehensive state system in human history. Here, Deneen offers an astringent warning that the centripetal forces now at work on our political culture are not superficial flaws but inherent features of a system whose success is generating its own failure.",

It presents a profound and challenging investigation into the nature of human reason, its knowledge and its illusions. Reason, Kant argues, is the seat of certain concepts that precede experience and make it possible, but we are not therefore entitled to draw conclusions about the natural world from these concepts. The <i>Critique</i> brings together the two opposing schools of philosophy: rationalism, which grounds all our knowledge in reason, and empiricism, which traces all our knowledge to experience. Kant\\'s transcendental idealism indicates a third way that goes far beyond these alternatives.",

As the classic story, first told over half a century ago, moves forward, the greatest love affair in all fiction is reignited; amidst heartbreak and joy, the endless, consuming passion between Scarlett O\\'Hara and Rhett Butler reaches its startling culmination.

A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she's never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.  Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he's nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn't at all who he's been claiming to be.

He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?  His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.",

But even her affairs bring her disappointment, and when real life continues to fail to live up to her romantic expectations, the consequences are devastating. Flaubert\\'s erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: \\'Madame Bovary, c\\'est moi.\\'  This modern translation by Flaubert\\'s biographer, Geoffrey Wall, retains all the delicacy and precision of the French original. The edition also contains a preface by the novelist Mich\\xc3\\xa8le Roberts.",

He was still alive when the gassings ceased in November 1944. He saw millions come and disappear; by sheer luck he survived. Muller is neither a historian nor a psychologist; he is a source--one of the few prisoners who saw the Jewish people die and lived to tell about it. Eyewitness Auschwitz is one of the key documents of the Holocaust.",

The story follows Santiago, a young shepherd who lives in Spain, on a journey to fulfil his personal legend and find his treasure in the Pyramids of Egypt The Advertiser, an Australian newspaper, published one of the first reviews of The Alchemist in 1993 saying \"of books that I can recommend with the unshakable confidence of having read them and been entranced, impressed, entertained or moved, the universal gift is perhaps a limpid little fable called The Alchemist... In hauntingly spare prose, translated from the Brazilian original in Portuguese, it follows a young Andalusian shepherd into the desert on his quest for a dream and the fulfilment of his destiny.\" Since then, the novel has received nearly universal praise, making it to the top spot on best seller lists in 74 countries and winning prestigious awards in Germany and Italy.

      "description": "Auschwitz-Birkenau is the site of the largest mass murder in human history. Yet its story is not fully known. In Auschwitz, Laurence Rees reveals new insights from more than 100 original interviews with Auschwitz survivors and Nazi perpetrators who speak on the record for the first time. Their testimonies provide a portrait of the inner workings of the camp in unrivalled detail\\xe2\\x80\\x94from the techniques of mass murder, to the politics and gossip mill that turned between guards and prisoners, to the on-camp brothel in which the lines between those guards and prisoners became surprisingly blurred. Rees examines the strategic decisions that led the Nazi leadership to prescribe Auschwitz as its primary site for the extinction of Europe\\'s Jews\\xe2\\x80\\x94their \"Final Solution.\" He concludes that many of the horrors that were perpetrated in Auschwitz were driven not just by ideological inevitability but as a \"practical\" response to a war in the East that had begun to go wrong for Germany. A terrible immoral pragmatism characterizes many of the decisions that determined what happened at Auschwitz. Thus the story of the camp becomes a morality tale, too, in which evil is shown to proceed in a series of deft, almost noiseless incremental steps until it produces the overwhelming horror of the industrial scale slaughter that was inflicted in the gas chambers of Auschwitz",

He attends a prestigious private school on scholarship and his parents are reasonably well off.    Yet life hasn\\'t been easy for Jason. He has spent most of high school being tormented by both the students and faculty and his parents are never home.    Frustrated and alone, his one escape has always been video games. In-game, he can feel the type of power and freedom he lacks in his day-to-day life. Fortunately, a new virtual reality game (the first of its kind) has just been released, which promises the opportunity for an even greater escape.    Once he begins playing, Jason quickly finds himself on the path to becoming the game's villain. In the process, he also starts to suspect that there is something unusual going on within the game.

      "description": "Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0380018179 (ISBN13: 9780380018178) The Thorn Birds is a robust, romantic saga of a singular family, the Clearys. It begins in the early part of this century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O\\'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.  The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph\\'s course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie\\'s except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.  Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie\\'s children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.

      "description": "<i>The Essential Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe</i>, by Edgar Allan Poe, is part of the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.   Creator of the modern detective story, innovative architect of the horror genre, and a poet of extraordinary musicality, Edgar Allan Poe remains one of America\\'s most popular and influential writers. His tales and poems brim with psychological depth, almost painful intensity, and unexpected\\xe2\\x80\\x94and surprisingly modern\\xe2\\x80\\x94flashes of dark humor and irony.  This anthology offers an exceptionally generous selection of Poe\\'s short stories. It includes his famed masterpieces, such as \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" and \"The Purloined Letter,\" featuring Poe\\'s great detective, Dupin; his insightful studies of madness \"The Black Cat\" and \"The Tell-Tale Heart\"; \"The Gold-Bug,\" his delightful exercise in \"code-breaking\"; and important but lesser-known tales, such as \"Bon-Bon,\" \"The Assignation,\" and \"King Pest.\" Also included are some of Poe\\'s most beloved poems, haunting lyrics of love and loss, such as \"Annabel Lee,\" nightmare phantasmagories such as \"The Raven,\" and his grand experiment in translating sound into words, \"The Bells.\"  Benjamin F. Fisher, Professor of English, University of Mississippi, is a longtime enthusiast of the works of Poe. He has published books, articles, and notes about Poe, and in American, Victorian, and Gothic studies, and serves on editorial boards for several professional journals. He has also been acclaimed for outstanding teaching.",
